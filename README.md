Developed a Computer Vision-Controlled robotic arm using
OpenCV and Python.

• OpenCV is an opensource computer vision library that
provides a set of tools for image and video processing.

• The objective of this project is to enable the Prosthetic Arm
to respond to real-time inputs and adapt to changing
circumstances, which is an essential requirement for many
industrial, manufacturing, healthcare, and rehabilitation
applications.
